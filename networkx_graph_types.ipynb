    "## Differences between the `MultiDiGraph` and the `DiGraph`"
   ],

    "Both `MultiDiGraph` and `DiGraph` are classes provided by the `networkx` library in Python for the creation and manipulation of directed graphs. The primary distinction between the two is how they handle edges between nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Multiple Edges**:\n",
    "   - **MultiDiGraph**: Supports multiple directed edges between any pair of nodes. This is useful when you want to model scenarios where multiple relationships can exist between two nodes. For instance, if you were modeling flight routes between cities, there might be multiple daily flights between two cities.\n",
    "   - **DiGraph**: Supports only one directed edge between any pair of nodes. If you try to add another edge with the same source and destination nodes, it will either overwrite the existing edge or not add the new edge, depending on the provided attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use Cases**:\n",
    "   - **MultiDiGraph**: When you have scenarios with multiple relationships or attributes between nodes. Examples include:\n",
    "     - Road networks where you might have multiple types of roads (like a highway and a secondary road) connecting two places.\n",
    "     - Bioinformatics applications where multiple types of interactions might be present between two entities.\n",
    "   - **DiGraph**: When your directed graph model needs only single relationships between node pairs. It's more memory efficient than MultiDiGraph for such cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Complexity**:\n",
    "   - **MultiDiGraph**: Adds some complexity when you iterate over edges or query the graph, because you'll have to account for the possibility of multiple edges between nodes.\n",
    "   - **DiGraph**: Simpler to work with when you are certain that no multiple edges between nodes are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Memory Consumption**:\n",
    "   - **MultiDiGraph**: Typically consumes more memory than DiGraph due to the capability to store multiple edges between nodes.\n",
    "   - **DiGraph**: More memory efficient when you don't need multiple edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the choice between `MultiDiGraph` and `DiGraph` depends on the requirements of your specific application. If you need to model multiple relationships or interactions between nodes, `MultiDiGraph` is the better choice. On the other hand, if there can be at most one directed relationship between any pair of nodes, then `DiGraph` is more appropriate (and more efficient in terms of memory consumption)."

   ],
   "metadata": {}
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "source": [
    "Certainly! The `nx.all_simple_paths` method in `networkx` is used to find all simple paths (paths without cycles) from a given source to a given target in a graph `G`, with an optional cutoff for path length. \n",
    "\n",
    "The behavior of this method is influenced by the type of graph you use (`DiGraph` vs. `MultiDiGraph`). Here's how:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Path Multiplicity**:\n",
    "   - **MultiDiGraph**: Since a `MultiDiGraph` can have multiple edges between any pair of nodes, there can be multiple paths between two nodes that are structurally the same except for the edge they use. For example, if node A has two directed edges to node B, and you're finding all simple paths from A to B, then the path will be listed twice (once for each edge) even though structurally it's the same path.\n",
    "   - **DiGraph**: With a `DiGraph`, there's at most one directed edge between any pair of nodes. So, the same path will not appear multiple times due to different edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Performance**:\n",
    "   - **MultiDiGraph**: Might be slower when finding all simple paths if the graph has a lot of nodes that are interconnected with multiple edges. The method will try to explore all possible paths, and having multiple edges between nodes can significantly increase the number of paths to explore.\n",
    "   - **DiGraph**: Typically faster than the corresponding `MultiDiGraph` because it doesn't have the overhead of dealing with multiple edges between nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output Size**:\n",
    "   - **MultiDiGraph**: Could result in a larger output list of paths due to the multiple edges between nodes, especially if the source and target are part of a densely connected subgraph.\n",
    "   - **DiGraph**: The output list of paths will generally be smaller than or equal to that from a `MultiDiGraph` due to the lack of multiple edges between nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Complexity**:\n",
    "   - **MultiDiGraph**: Handling the result can be slightly more complex since you might need to account for or filter out paths that are structurally the same but use different edges.\n",
    "   - **DiGraph**: The result is straightforward, as there won't be duplicate paths due to multiple edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, while `nx.all_simple_paths` will work with both `DiGraph` and `MultiDiGraph`, you might experience differences in performance, output size, and the complexity of post-processing the output. When using it with a `MultiDiGraph`, you should be aware of the potential for multiple similar paths and be prepared to handle a larger output list. **If you're only interested in distinct structural paths and not the particular edges used**, you might consider collapsing the `MultiDiGraph` into a `DiGraph` or post-processing the results to remove duplicates."
