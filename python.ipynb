    "The differences between using asyncio.sleep(0) and asyncio.sleep(0.01) lie in the behavior of these two approaches in an asynchronous context. Here are the main distinctions and typical use cases for each:\n",
    "\n",
    "asyncio.sleep(0):\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: This is often used as a way to yield control back to the event loop immediately, allowing other pending asynchronous tasks to run before continuing the execution of the current task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delay: Essentially no delay. It's meant to be non-blocking and merely provides a way to give the event loop a chance to process other tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Preventing blocking: Use it when you want to ensure that other asynchronous tasks have an opportunity to run, especially in situations where you have a tight loop or a long-running computation.\n",
    "Mitigating \"starvation\": If you have multiple asynchronous tasks running concurrently and one of them is very CPU-intensive, using asyncio.sleep(0) can help prevent that task from starving other tasks of CPU time.\n",
    "asyncio.sleep(0.01):\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: This introduces a small delay of 0.01 seconds (10 milliseconds) before allowing the event loop to continue with the current task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delay: A small delay is introduced, which can be useful for scenarios where you want to introduce a pause or rate-limiting effect without fully blocking the event loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Rate limiting: You might use asyncio.sleep(0.01) to limit the rate at which a particular operation is performed. For example, if you want to make API requests at a controlled rate, you can introduce a delay between requests.\n",
    "Simulation: In some simulations or animations, a small delay can be used to control the frame rate or simulate a process that occurs at a specific time interval.\n",
    "In summary, asyncio.sleep(0) is often used to yield control immediately and allow other tasks to run within the same event loop iteration. It's primarily used for non-blocking purposes to improve concurrency and prevent tasks from monopolizing the event loop. On the other hand, asyncio.sleep(0.01) introduces a small, controlled delay and is used for scenarios where you want to introduce some pacing or rate limiting into your asynchronous code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between them depends on your specific use case and whether you need immediate yielding with minimal delay (asyncio.sleep(0)) or a controlled delay (asyncio.sleep(0.01)) for a specific purpose like rate limiting or pacing."
