    "\n",
    "This function returns a generator that yields all simple paths (paths without repeated nodes) between two given nodes in a graph.\n",
    "It explores all possible paths in the graph, even if they are not the shortest paths.\n",
    "You can specify the source and target nodes and optionally a cutoff parameter to limit the maximum path length.\n",
    "This function is useful when you want to find all possible paths between two nodes, regardless of their length.\n",
    "all_shortest_paths:\n",
    "\n",
    "This function returns a generator that yields all shortest paths between two given nodes in a graph.\n",
    "It focuses on finding paths with the minimum number of edges between the source and target nodes.\n",
    "Unlike all_simple_paths, which considers all paths, this function only returns the paths that are of the shortest length.\n",
    "You can specify the source and target nodes, and the function will only find the shortest paths between them.\n",
    "In summary, the key difference between these two functions lies in their purpose and the types of paths they generate. all_simple_paths finds all possible paths, while all_shortest_paths specifically finds the shortest paths. Your choice of which function to use will depend on the specific analysis you are conducting on the graph."
