    "To optimize your query while maintaining the 5-hop distance but adding a relationship filter, you need to focus on constraining the search space. The key is to reduce the number of paths the query has to explore, which can significantly improve performance. Here are some strategies to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Filtering by Relationship Type**: If you have specific types of relationships that are more relevant, you can filter by those. For example, if you're only interested in certain types of relationships between 'InformationResource' and 'Publication', specify those in your query.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using Directional Relationships**: If the relationships in your graph are directional and this directionality is meaningful for your query, make sure to use it. Directional queries are often faster than undirected ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Limiting Intermediate Nodes**: If certain types of nodes are not relevant for your paths, you can exclude them. For example, you might want to traverse only through nodes of a certain type or with certain properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Reducing Maximum Path Length**: Even though you want to keep a 5-hop distance, consider if all 5 hops are necessary for every path. If some paths could be meaningful with fewer hops, you could run a separate query for shorter paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Indexing**: Ensure that the nodes and relationships you are querying are properly indexed. Indexes can significantly speed up lookup times for starting and ending nodes of your paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Batch Processing**: If the query is still too large, consider processing it in smaller batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s how you can modify your query to include a relationship filter. This example assumes you want to filter for a specific relationship type called 'SPECIFIC_RELATIONSHIP':\n",
    "\n",
    "```cypher\n",
    "MATCH p=(start:Entity {name: 'InformationResource'})-[:RELATED_TO*..5]->(end:Entity {name: 'Publication'})\n",
    "WHERE all(r in relationships(p) WHERE type(r) = 'SPECIFIC_RELATIONSHIP')\n",
    "CALL algo.all_simple_paths(start, end, ['>'], 5)\n",
    "YIELD path\n",
    "RETURN path;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This query modification will limit the paths to those where all relationships are of type 'SPECIFIC_RELATIONSHIP'. Adjust the relationship type and the WHERE clause as needed for your specific use case."
