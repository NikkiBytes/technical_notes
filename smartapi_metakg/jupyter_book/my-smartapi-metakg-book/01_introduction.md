## SmartAPI

[SmartAPI](https://smart-api.info/) is an open-source framework that facilitates the integration of biomedical data sources by providing a standardized metadata format. It helps users discover APIs that expose biomedical data, making it easier to interact with diverse datasets through consistent metadata specifications. By registering APIs in the [SmartAPI Registry](https://smart-api.info/registry), it supports seamless interaction with APIs that follow its guidelines, ensuring interoperability in the biomedical research community.
  
> *The **SmartAPI** project aims to enhance the **FAIRness** (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) of web-based APIs. It leverages the **OpenAPI Specification v3** and **JSON-LD** to provide semantically annotated metadata, ensuring APIs are discoverable and reusable. This structured metadata helps APIs integrate seamlessly with other data sources, promoting interoperability across different platforms.*

## SmartAPI MetaKG

The [SmartAPI MetaKG](https://smart-api.info/metaKG) is designed to bridge the gap between biomedical APIs and knowledge graph applications. By **indexing metadata from SmartAPI-registered APIs** and organizing them into a unified knowledge graph structure, the MetaKG provides a powerful tool for researchers to discover and query interconnections between various biomedical entities.

#### Background
The **SmartAPI MetaKG** integrates metadata from various biomedical APIs to create a knowledge graph that connects entities like genes, diseases, and drugs. It serves as a unified source for researchers, enabling discovery and analysis of relationships across diverse datasets.

### Key Benefits and Purpose
The primary benefits and goals of the SmartAPI MetaKG include:
- **Data Integration**: Combining heterogeneous data sources with standardized metadata.
- **API Discovery**: Simplifying the process of finding APIs relevant to biomedical research.
- **Facilitating Discovery**: Uncovering hidden connections between biomedical concepts (e.g., genes, diseases, drugs).
- **Query Pathfinding**: Enabling dynamic and efficient queries to find paths between biomedical concepts.
- **Interoperability**: Enhancing integration by mapping diverse metadata to a common schema.
- **Supporting Computational Tools**: Providing structured data for AI and machine learning applications.

This book outlines the development, functionality, and impact of the **SmartAPI MetaKG** and showcases its capabilities through interactive examples.


### Impact: Advancing Biomedical Research with the MetaKG

The SmartAPI MetaKG is transforming the way biomedical research integrates diverse datasets into knowledge graphs. By offering a unified structure for API metadata, it enhances the discoverability and interoperability of data sources, making them more accessible for researchers.

**Real-World Examples**:
- The **Su and Wu Labs at Scripps Research** utilize MetaKG to map complex gene-disease relationships, supporting drug repurposing efforts.
- **Monarch Initiative** and **Reactome** are leveraging the MetaKG to improve pathway analysis and gene-to-disease mappings in their research.

Through these and other collaborations, the MetaKG helps facilitate dynamic, efficient querying of biomedical relationships, leading to better-informed hypotheses and discoveries.


#### Architecture
The architecture of the SmartAPI MetaKG involves three main components:
1. **SmartAPI Metadata Parser**: Extracts and standardizes metadata from APIs.
2. **MetaKG Index**: Organizes the metadata into a graph structure for easy exploration.
3. **Query Modules**: Facilitate pathfinding and complex queries.

Here’s a visual representation of the architecture, highlighting how these components work together to support the MetaKG’s functionality.
