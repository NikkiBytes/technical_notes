# Introduction

Welcome to the jupyter book about the SmartAPI MetaKG Index, a key component of the BioThings Translator project developed at the Su and Wu Labs of Scripps Research Institute.

The **SmartAPI MetaKG** is designed to bridge the gap between biomedical APIs and knowledge graph applications. By **indexing metadata from SmartAPI-registered APIs and organizing them into a unified knowledge graph structure**, the MetaKG provides a powerful tool for researchers to discover and query interconnections between various biomedical entities.

### Purpose of the SmartAPI MetaKG

The primary goals of the SmartAPI MetaKG include:
- **API Discovery**: Simplifying the process of finding APIs that provide data relevant to biomedical research.
- **Query Pathfinding**: Enabling dynamic and efficient queries to find paths between biomedical concepts (e.g., genes, diseases, drugs).
- **Interoperability**: Enhancing the integration of diverse data sources by mapping their metadata to a common schema.

This book outlines the development, functionality, and impact of the SmartAPI MetaKG and showcases its capabilities through interactive examples.
